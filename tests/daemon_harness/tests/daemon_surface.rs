//! What a client gets when it talks to a daemon.
//!
//! Each case here exists because a piece of the harness would be useless if
//! it were wrong, and asserting that piece once keeps every later scenario
//! from having to. They are also the first tests in this workspace that reach
//! the model over HTTP: everything else fakes it at the `AnthropicClient`
//! seam, which skips request serialization, the SSE decoder and the retry
//! loop — three things a daemon depends on.
//!
//! # Two modes
//!
//! Every case is written against a [`Mode`] and run twice. In this process it
//! is fast and runs by default; against a spawned `attacored` it is
//! `#[ignore]`d, like every other case here that starts a subprocess, and CI
//! runs it in the ignored step.
//!
//! The parity is the claim being tested. A case that passes in one mode and
//! not the other has found something real: the spawned daemon resolves its
//! own settings, its own paths and its own model endpoint from a command line
//! and an environment, and every one of those is a step the in-process build
//! is handed rather than takes.
