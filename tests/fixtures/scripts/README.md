# Script fixtures

One script per extension point a script can be bound to, used by
`tests/runner/tests/script_carrier.rs` to prove that a `scripts` section in
`Settings` ends up changing what the model is sent.

They are committed unpackaged and read straight off disk — the same shape as
`tests/fixtures/plugins/demo-plugin`, minus the packaging step a plugin needs
and a script does not.

Each one leaves a mark no other part of the engine produces. That is the
whole design constraint: a fixture that logged, or that made a change the
engine would have made anyway, would let the test pass with the script never
running.

`broken/` holds the ones that misbehave on purpose — throwing, never
returning, allocating without bound, answering in a shape its point cannot
act on, asking for a name the engine owns. They are how the carrier's promises
about failure get checked instead of believed; see `docs/testing_scripts.md`.
