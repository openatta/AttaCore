//! One task, four sets of scripts, and what is left on disk afterwards.
//!
//! Every other case here binds one or two points and looks at what reached the
//! model. That answers "does this point work" and leaves the question an
//! operator actually asks — *if I bind all of these at once, does my agent
//! still do its job?* — untouched.
//!
//! So this runs a real piece of work: read a file, fix a line, read it back.
//! Real tools, a real working directory, a scripted model for the decisions.
//! The same work runs four times:
//!
//! | profile | bound | what must be true |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | none | nothing | the task finished; this is the baseline |
//! | observers | all nine points, none changing the outcome | the directory is **byte for byte** the baseline's, and every point ran |
//! | intervening | the same, with one ring refusing edits | the directory differs in exactly the way that ring declared |
//! | broken | all nine, every one throwing | the directory is the baseline's again, and every point failed |
//!
//! # Why the ledger is not optional here
//!
//! The observers profile and the broken profile leave *the same directory* —
//! one because every script ran and changed nothing that matters, the other
//! because every script died. Nothing on disk tells them apart, and neither
//! can be told from a run with no scripts at all. The ledger is the only place
//! the difference exists, which is what makes it the load-bearing assertion
//! rather than a diagnostic.
//!
//! # Why no golden file
//!
//! The baseline is computed in the same run as the profiles compared against
//! it, so there is no file to go stale and nothing to regenerate reflexively.
//! What the task itself does is pinned by the scripted replies.
