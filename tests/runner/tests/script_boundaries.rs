//! The promises the script carrier makes when a script misbehaves.
//!
//! Every case here is a sentence already written in `docs/extending_quickjs.md`
//! — a failing script changes nothing, a budget is per turn, a deadline reaches
//! inside the interpreter, a script from outside may only add, one bad binding
//! drops the whole set. They are the reason an operator is willing to run
//! somebody's JavaScript inside their agent, and none of them was checked
//! against a running session.
//!
//! Kept apart from `script_carrier.rs` on purpose. Those cases are about
//! coverage — this point works, and here is the mark that proves it — and a red
//! one usually means a fixture needs updating. A red one here means the engine
//! stopped keeping a promise, and nobody should be able to make it green by
//! regenerating anything.
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! A build with no script carrier refuses a `scripts` section rather than
//! ignoring it. That is a compile-time guard in `daemon`, and a test running in
//! a build that *has* the carrier cannot observe the build that does not.
