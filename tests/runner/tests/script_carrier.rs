//! Does a `scripts` section actually change what the model is sent?
//!
//! Every other test of the script carrier stops one step short: the unit
//! tests call an adapter directly, and the binding tests in `script-host`
//! check that a file on disk produces an adapter. Neither runs a session, so
//! neither would notice a point that binds correctly and is then never
//! consulted, or an adapter installed on a builder nobody reads.
//!
//! So this drives a real `Agent`, from real `Settings`, with the scripts read
//! off `tests/fixtures/scripts/`, and asserts on what reached
//! `ScriptedModel`. Each fixture leaves a `SCRIPT-TRACE-` mark that nothing
//! else in the engine produces — a script that logged, or that made a change
//! the engine would have made anyway, would let this pass without running.
//!
//! # Three runs per point
//!
//! **Bound** is the one that looks like the feature. **Unbound** is the one
//! that makes it mean something: without it, "the mark is in the request"
//! would also be satisfied by a mark that was in the request all along.
//! **Broken** — the same point, bound to a script that throws — is the one
//! that would catch the worst failure, an adapter that half-applies what a
//! dead script asked for. It reads the ledger rather than the request,
//! because the whole claim is that nothing observable happened; a run where
//! the script was never bound at all would look identical.
//!
//! # Adding a point
//!
//! Add a fixture beside the others, add a row to [`cases`], and give it a
//! mark of its own. A point that has no adapter yet has no row: a case
//! asserting that an unbound point changes nothing passes for the wrong
//! reason.
