//! A `Model` whose every answer is written down in the test, not recorded from
//! a provider.
//!
//! # Why not cassettes
//!
//! The recorder already gives deterministic replay, and reaching for it first
//! is the obvious move. It does not work as a *committed* regression net, for
//! two independent reasons:
//!
//! 1. `tests/fixtures/cassettes/` is gitignored on purpose. The rationale is
//!    in `.gitignore` itself: a recorded request bakes in the exact model
//!    name, prompt text and tool table, so a committed cassette goes stale the
//!    moment any of those change. Replay compares blob *ids* — content
//!    addresses — so "goes stale" means "every case fails".
//! 2. That staleness is not hypothetical for this refactor. The tickets this
//!    net exists to protect (prompt block naming, the registration contract,
//!    the assembly hook) all change prompt assembly deliberately. A cassette
//!    net would fail on every one of them for the intended reason, which
//!    trains people to regenerate the goldens without reading the diff —
//!    the failure mode that makes a regression net worse than none.
//!
//! So the model is scripted instead. The script is a few lines of Rust, it
//! commits, it costs nothing to run, and it is indifferent to prompt wording —
//! which is what lets it stay sensitive to the thing actually under test: the
//! turn loop's decisions.
//!
//! It also reaches cases a recording cannot. There is no way to ask a real
//! provider for a 529 on the third call, and the existing cassettes contain no
//! error outcomes at all, so overload/fallback, prompt-too-long recovery and
//! `max_tokens` continuation are only reproducible by scripting them.
//!
//! # What it does not cover
//!
//! Nothing here checks the *request*. Whether the assembled prompt is correct
//! is what the cassette machinery and `run_rerun.sh` are for; this asserts
//! what the engine does with a given sequence of answers.
