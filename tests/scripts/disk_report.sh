# What this checkout is using, and how much of it is dead.
#
# One clean build of this workspace is ~13 GB, and that is not waste: every
# integration test file is its own binary that statically links the whole
# graph — wasmtime and cranelift alone are half a gigabyte of rlib — so a
# test binary lands around 190 MB and there are dozens of them. Stripping
# barely moves it (~18 MB on macOS, where the debug info is not in the
# binary to begin with): that size is machine code.
#
# What does turn into waste is that cargo never collects. A superseded set
# stays on disk exactly as long as the live one, so the number to watch is
# not "how big is target" but "how much of it has nothing to do with the
# current build" — which is what this reports.

  1. Bumping the workspace version. Every crate's fingerprint changes, so the
     whole set is rebuilt and the previous one is orphaned in place. This is
     the usual cause of a sudden double-digit jump — clean after a bump.

  2. Building a different feature combination. Each keeps its own set:
       cargo build --workspace                      default, with the plugin compiler
       cargo build -p daemon --no-default-features  no plugin subsystem at all
       cargo build -p daemon --features plugins     plugins without the compiler
     (`locked_build.sh` builds the last two into a throwaway target dir of its
     own for exactly this reason, so it leaves nothing behind here.)

  3. Changing a dependency version or the toolchain. Same story.

  Note: several hashes behind one target name is NOT a staleness signal.
  A pristine tree has three `attacored-<hash>` executables — the binary, its
  own test harness, and the feature-varied build — because the hash encodes
  the feature set, not the age. Counting them was tried here and reported
  four "duplicates" on a freshly cleaned checkout, which is why the number
  above is measured by mtime instead.

  Routine, keeps the live set:
    cargo sweep --time ${STALE_DAYS}      # cargo install cargo-sweep

  After a version bump, or when the number above is most of the total:
    cargo clean

  tests/fixtures/*/target belong to separate workspaces, so the top-level
  clean does not touch them:
    find tests/fixtures -name target -maxdepth 2 -type d -exec rm -rf {} +

  Test scratch directories, if a run was killed before its tempdirs dropped:
    rm -rf "\${TMPDIR:-/tmp}"/atta-* "\${TMPDIR:-/tmp}"/attacode-*

  A full rebuild after a clean is about 1m10s on an M-series laptop, which is
  the whole cost of being wrong about what was still needed.
