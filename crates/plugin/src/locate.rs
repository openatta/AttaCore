//! Finding the companion files a build ships *beside* its executable rather
//! than inside it — the DSH bridge module, the out-of-process component
//! compiler.
//!
//! Lives in this crate rather than in `plugin-host` because the package layer
//! needs the same search and must stay compilable without a WebAssembly
//! runtime; two copies of "walk up from the executable" would drift the day
//! one of them learned about a new install layout.
