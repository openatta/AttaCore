//! FullCompact — LLM-written structured summary of the conversation that is
//! about to be discarded.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Every other strategy in this crate is lossy without a handoff. `Snip` drops
//! the oldest API rounds outright — no summary, no note that anything was
//! removed. `MicroCompact` blanks old tool results. `CollapseContext`, the last
//! resort, truncates each text block to 200 bytes and joins them with `" | "`,
//! which produces noise rather than a summary. Any long session therefore lost
//! its own history silently.
//!
//! # Where it sits in the cascade
//!
//! **First**, ahead of Snip — see the module header of [`crate::compact`].
//! Placement is forced by the requirement that the summary describe what is
//! being thrown away: a summarizer that ran *after* Snip could only ever
//! summarize the rounds Snip chose to keep, which are the rounds still in
//! context and the ones least in need of summarizing. Summarize, then drop.
//!
//! # Why it is not unconditional
//!
//! It costs a real (if cheap-routed) API round-trip and adds latency to the
//! user's turn, so [`should_summarize`] gates it on there being enough history
//! at stake to be worth the call — see [`MIN_SUMMARIZED_TOKENS`]. Below that,
//! the plain Snip cascade is both faster and adequate.
//!
//! # Degradation
//!
//! Nothing here is allowed to fail a turn. A model error, a malformed/empty
//! response, or a timeout all surface as `Err(CompactError)`, and the caller
//! falls through to the LLM-free cascade exactly as if no summarizer had been
//! configured.

/// recovery also re-attaches, so the summary and the recovery attachments
/// describe the same world.
const SUMMARY_PROMPT: &str = "\
You are compacting an AI coding agent's conversation. The turns below are about \
to be removed from the agent's context permanently; your summary is the only \
thing that will survive to tell it what happened.

Write a summary under exactly these nine headings, in this order. Use a heading \
even when you have nothing for it — write \"None.\" underneath. Be specific: \
name real files, real identifiers, real commands, real error text. Do not \
editorialize, do not praise, do not speculate about what the user \"probably\" \
wants.

1. User intent — what the user asked for, in their own framing, including any \
later corrections or changes of direction. Quote short decisive phrases.
2. Key technical context — the concepts, architecture, constraints and \
conventions established so far that the agent must not re-derive or contradict.
3. Files and symbols — every file read, created or modified, with absolute paths \
where known, and for each one what it contains or what changed. Include exact \
code snippets only where the precise text is load-bearing.
4. Errors and fixes — failures encountered (compiler errors, test failures, \
runtime errors, tool errors), what caused each, and how it was resolved. Note \
any that are still unresolved.
5. Problem solving — approaches tried and rejected, and why, so the agent does \
not retry a dead end.
6. User instructions and constraints — standing rules the user gave (scope \
limits, files not to touch, style requirements, commit conventions). These bind \
future work; state them verbatim where wording matters.
7. Pending work — everything explicitly asked for that is not yet done.
8. Environment state — skills invoked, tools activated, background tasks still \
running, working directory, branch, and any long-lived shell/process state.
9. Current work and next step — what was happening at the moment of \
compaction, and the single most immediate next action. If the next step is not \
clearly implied by the user's request, say so rather than inventing one.
