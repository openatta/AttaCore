//! Compactor — context compression when token budget exceeded.
//!
//! The production chain, in the order the runtime applies it:
//!
//! 0. **FullCompact** ([`crate::llm_summary`]) — an LLM writes a structured
//!    multi-section handoff summary of the rounds that are about to be
//!    discarded, and the summary replaces them. Runs *first*, because every
//!    layer below it is lossy: a summary produced after Snip has already run
//!    can only summarize what Snip left behind. Gated (see
//!    `llm_summary::should_summarize`) so it costs an API call only when
//!    compaction is actually about to destroy a meaningful amount of history.
//! 1. **Snip** — drop oldest API rounds. Used when FullCompact is unavailable
//!    (no summarizer wired), declines, or fails.
//! 2. **MicroCompact** — clear old tool result content in-place.
//! 3. **CollapseContext** — fold old rounds into a truncation-joined digest,
//!    keeping recent rounds. Last resort; produces noise, not a summary.
//!
//! `DefaultCompactor` implements layers 1–3 and stays LLM-free, so it remains
//! usable as a `Compactor` in contexts with no model available.
