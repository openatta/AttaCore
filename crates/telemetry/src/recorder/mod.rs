//! Recorder — records every LLM call and replays it deterministically.
//!
//! A `Model` decorator sitting on `Model::stream()`, the one place in the
//! engine that sees a complete request and a complete response at once: the
//! turn loop assembles the request but hands the stream away, and the stream
//! consumer sees the response but not what produced it.
//!
//! What it produces is diagnostic data, not session state. It takes no part in
//! resume, fork, or context reconstruction — deleting a recording leaves the
//! session working exactly as before. `crates/history` remains the sole
//! authority on what a conversation is.
//!
//! Replay matches by **position**, not by hashing the request: the k-th live
//! call replays the k-th recorded one. Hash-keyed lookup makes every
//! environment-dependent byte in a prompt a correctness problem, and when it
//! misses it can only report that it missed. Recording the whole request
//! instead means a mismatch can name the field that moved.
//!
//! **A recording holds everything the model saw, in the clear.** System
//! prompts, the whole conversation, tool arguments and results — verbatim, and
//! deliberately not passed through [`crate::RedactionPolicy`], which exists for
//! telemetry events and would defeat the point here: a recording is worth
//! keeping only if it says what was actually sent. So a recording carries
//! whatever secrets the prompt carried, and its directory deserves the same
//! handling as the transcript it came from. Recording is off unless configured.
//!
//! See `docs/recorder_design.md`.
