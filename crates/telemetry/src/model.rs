//! A `Model` that reports what the calls no turn made have cost.
//!
//! `api_request` was emitted from one place, inside the turn loop, so it
//! described exactly the calls a turn makes and nothing else. The engine
//! makes others: it extracts memories once a turn is over, summarizes for
//! compaction, answers a `"type": "prompt"` hook, classifies an intent. Every
//! one of them is a real request to a real provider that somebody pays for,
//! and a host reading this telemetry saw none of them — a session with memory
//! enabled undercounted by one call per turn, silently.
//!
//! They cannot be reported from where they are made. Two of those call sites
//! live in `base`, which cannot depend on this crate, and threading a handle
//! to each one would leave the next one to be added unreported again. What
//! they have in common is the model they call, so that is where the counting
//! goes: one decorator, and any call carrying an auxiliary [`CallOrigin`] is
//! accounted for by the fact that it happened.
//!
//! The turn's own calls stay with the turn loop. It knows things this does
//! not — which turn, how many messages went out, how many tools were offered
//! — and an event reported from both places would be counted twice. Which is
//! also the rule for wrapping: exactly once, around the model a session was
//! built with. A model fetched from somewhere else — the task router hands
//! out pool-level ones, shared and built before any session existed — is
//! outside that wrapping and has to be wrapped by whoever fetched it. There
//! is one such fetcher, `runtime::turn::Turn::accounted`.
