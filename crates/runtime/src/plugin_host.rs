//! `PluginHost` — the entire surface installed plugins present to the engine.
//!
//! Everything a plugin can contribute arrives through this one trait, and the
//! host holds it as an `Option`. That is what lets the plugin subsystem be
//! compiled out (`daemon`'s `plugins` feature): with no implementation linked
//! in, the option is `None` and every call site is an `if let Some(..)` that
//! does nothing — no `#[cfg]` scattered through the engine, and no behavior
//! difference to reason about beyond "there are no plugins".
//!
//! There are five contribution points — tools, MCP servers, hook
//! subscriptions, scenes, agent types — plus two supporting methods that
//! serve them rather than adding new ones ([`PluginHost::hook_executor`] is
//! the backend for the hook subscriptions; [`PluginHost::permission_rules`]
//! is data the host merges). Each contribution point is a seam the engine
//! has to keep working across refactors, so adding a sixth is a decision to
//! argue for, not a detail to slip in.
