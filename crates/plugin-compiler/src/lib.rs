//! `atta-plugin-compile` — turns a plugin's components into machine code.
//!
//! Exists so the daemon does not have to. A build serving plugins can run
//! without Cranelift linked at all, which makes "this process cannot compile
//! WebAssembly" a fact the type system enforces rather than a policy someone
//! has to keep enforcing; the compiling has to happen somewhere, and this is
//! where.
//!
//! Run against a plugin's installed directory. Every `[[wasm]]` component the
//! manifest declares is compiled and its artifact written into that
//! directory's `.aot/`, which is exactly where the runtime looks.
