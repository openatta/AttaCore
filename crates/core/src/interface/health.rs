//! `HealthCheck` — whether the engine, and what a host wired into it, is
//! working.
//!
//! Two things in this codebase already knew something about whether the engine
//! was well, and neither could be reached or extended from outside. `daemon`'s
//! `doctor` re-inspects the settings tiers, provider routing and hooks
//! configuration and answers an RPC; it exists only in the daemon, so an
//! embedder linking the engine directly has no way to ask. `wasm-host`'s fault
//! records decide when a plugin has trapped often enough to stop being called;
//! that verdict is acted on and never reported, so "three of your plugins have
//! been set aside" is a fact the process knows and nobody can see.
//!
//! Both are the same shape — something with state, asked "are you all right",
//! answering with a verdict and enough detail to act on. This is that shape as
//! a contract, so a host can read the engine's answers and add its own checks
//! beside them.
//!
//! # A check answers from what it already knows
//!
//! [`HealthCheck::check`] is synchronous and is expected to return promptly. A
//! probe that blocks on the subsystem it is probing turns "is the database
//! reachable" into a request that hangs exactly when the answer matters most,
//! and a health endpoint that hangs during an outage is worse than no health
//! endpoint. Both implementations the engine ships answer from state they
//! already hold — a fault counter, a file that is either there or not. A host
//! whose check needs to go over a network keeps a cached verdict, updated out
//! of band, and reports that.
//!
//! # A check reports, it does not repair
//!
//! Nothing here can change what the engine does. A check returns a verdict and
//! detail; there is no expression that reopens a circuit breaker, reloads
//! configuration or restarts anything. Diagnosis and action are different
//! decisions with different consequences, and a diagnostic that silently
//! repaired things would make every report a description of what it just did
//! rather than of what it found.
//!
//! # There is no `Err`
//!
//! A check that cannot determine the answer has determined something: it says
//! [`HealthStatus::Degraded`] and puts the reason in its summary. Returning a
//! `Result` would leave every caller deciding whether a failed check means
//! unhealthy or means nothing, and they would not all decide the same way.
