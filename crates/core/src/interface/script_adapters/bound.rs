//! A carrier turns files into adapters and has no way to install them, because
//! they belong in three different places: a prompt registry, the session
//! builder, and the carriers a turn resets. This is that answer as a value.
//!
//! It lives beside the adapters rather than with the carrier so the
//! *installing* can be written once. It was written twice for a day — in the
//! daemon and in the test that proves a script reaches the model — and the
//! copy in the test went stale the moment two more kinds of adapter existed.
//! A comment saying "mirrors the daemon" does not prevent that; having one
//! place does.
