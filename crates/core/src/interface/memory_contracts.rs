//! Where memories live, how they are found, and who decides what to keep.
//!
//! Memory was one concrete struct with a fixed directory layout, one search
//! that was a substring scan, and one retriever that was an LLM call written
//! inline. Every part of that is a reasonable default and none of it was a
//! choice: a host with memories in a database, a deployment that wants a
//! vector index, a project whose recall should be deterministic in tests —
//! none had anywhere to plug in.
//!
//! Four seams, matching the four things that are actually separable:
//!
//! * [`MemoryStorage`] — where the memories are.
//! * [`MemoryRetriever`] — which ones this turn should see.
//! * [`RetrievalHook`] — a look at the question before, and the answer after.
//! * [`ExtractionPolicy`] — what the model is told about writing memories
//!   down, which is the whole of the current extraction strategy.
//!
//! # The default is the old behavior, exactly
//!
//! `MemoryStore` implements the storage trait over the same directories, and
//! the shipped retriever is the same LLM selection call. A session that
//! registers nothing behaves as it did, which is what makes this safe to land
//! before anything uses it.
