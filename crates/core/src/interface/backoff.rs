//! `BackoffPolicy` — whether a failed request is tried again, and how long the
//! caller waits first.
//!
//! Every wire protocol the engine speaks needs this decision, and each one had
//! been answering it separately. The Anthropic client walked a six-step ladder
//! with ±25% jitter and deferred to a `retry-after` header when the provider
//! sent one; the OpenAI-compatible client walked a ladder with the same six
//! numbers, no jitter, and no notion of a server hint. Nothing held the two
//! together — the second was written to match the first and had already
//! drifted, silently, in the direction that matters most under load: without
//! jitter, every client that hits the same rate limit retries in lockstep.
//!
//! # What is protocol-specific and what is not
//!
//! Reading a `retry-after` header is protocol work: the header exists on one
//! side and not the other, and its spelling is part of the wire format. So
//! parsing stays in the client. What the number *means* — whether to honour
//! it, whether the attempt budget is spent, how long to actually sleep — is
//! not protocol work, and that is what moves here. A client's whole
//! contribution is to describe the failure it just had, in the four kinds
//! below, plus whatever the provider itself asked for.
//!
//! # The attempt budget is the policy's, not the caller's
//!
//! Both loops used to bound themselves by comparing an attempt counter against
//! the ladder's length, which put "how many times" in the caller and "how
//! long" in the table. They are one decision. The policy is asked after every
//! failure and answers [`Backoff::GiveUp`] when it is done, so a deployment
//! that wants four retries, or none, changes one thing rather than two.
