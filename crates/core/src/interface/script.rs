//! `ScriptEngine` — the cheap tier of extension backend.
//!
//! A hook point today can be answered three ways: a Rust implementation
//! compiled in, a command hook that pays for a subprocess, or a prompt hook
//! that pays for a model call. There is nothing between "recompile the engine"
//! and "spawn a process", so doing something small at a hook point — rewrite
//! one line of a prompt, tag a tool result, decide whether to retry — costs
//! either a release or several milliseconds and a PID.
//!
//! This is the missing tier: run a piece of the operator's own code, in this
//! process, in microseconds.
//!
//! # The engine is a separate crate, behind a feature
//!
//! This module is the contract and the governance around it, never an
//! interpreter: `base` has no internal dependencies and linking a JavaScript
//! runtime into it would put one in every build of everything. `script-host`
//! is the carrier crate — QuickJS behind this trait — and it is an optional
//! dependency of `daemon` under the `scripts` feature, the same way the wasm
//! carrier sits behind `plugins`. A build can carry one carrier, both, or
//! neither.
//!
//! [`RefusingEngine`] is what runs when a host wired nothing, and
//! [`FnScriptEngine`] gives a host the governance around logic written in
//! Rust.
//!
//! # Governance belongs here, not in the engine
//!
//! The timeout and the call quota are enforced by [`ScriptCarrier`], on this
//! side of the trait, because an engine that enforced its own limits would be
//! an engine that could choose not to. What the carrier *cannot* do from here
//! is stop a script that never yields: `tokio::time::timeout` abandons a
//! future, it does not interrupt a busy loop. An engine implementation must
//! provide its own interruption — every serious one has a fuel or watchdog
//! mechanism — and the carrier's timeout is the second line, not the first.
