//! `Elicitation` — the one way the engine asks a human something.
//!
//! Three questions in this engine need a person: may this tool call proceed,
//! what did you mean, and shall I import the configuration I found. Each grew
//! its own mechanism — a channel protocol for the first, a process-level
//! callback trait for the third, and for the second a tool that hands its own
//! question back to the model and calls that an answer. A host wanting to
//! answer all three had to learn all three, and a host that could answer none
//! of them got a different failure from each.
//!
//! # Silence is not consent
//!
//! With no implementation registered, every kind of question is *declined*
//! with a reason, never granted. That is the whole reason this is a trait with
//! a default rather than an `Option` each caller interprets: the fallback is
//! written once, here, and it fails closed.
//!
//! # Why the answer is a `Value`
//!
//! The three questions have genuinely different answers — a permission
//! decision, a chosen option or free text, an import choice — and a trait
//! object cannot be generic over them. So the payload is serde-shaped and
//! [`ElicitKind`] documents which type belongs to it. Every call site parses
//! with the type it expects and treats a parse failure exactly like a
//! decline, which keeps a confused implementation from being read as consent.
