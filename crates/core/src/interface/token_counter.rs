//! `TokenCounter` — how the engine decides how big a conversation is.
//!
//! Every budget decision rests on one number: how many tokens the context
//! currently holds. Compaction triggers on it, strategies choose what to drop
//! by it, and the warning shown to the user quotes it. That number came from
//! one hardcoded algorithm — a local `cl100k_base` tokenizer standing in for
//! Anthropic's, which nobody publishes — with no way for a host to supply a
//! better one.
//!
//! A better one is not hypothetical. A host talking to a provider with a
//! published tokenizer can count exactly. A host willing to spend a call on
//! `/v1/messages/count_tokens` can be exact for Anthropic too. Both are
//! strictly more accurate than an estimate documented to run 5–15% high, and
//! neither could be plugged in.
//!
//! # An estimate, not a measurement
//!
//! Implementations are not required to be exact, and callers must not treat
//! the result as if they were: it decides when to compact, not what is billed.
//! An implementation that is *cheap* and slightly wrong is a better default
//! than one that is exact and costs a network round-trip per turn, which is
//! why the shipped default is the local estimate.
