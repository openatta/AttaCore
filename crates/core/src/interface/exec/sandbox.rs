//! `Sandbox` — how a process is constrained.
//!
//! The split this contract exists to keep: a backend decides *how* to
//! constrain, the kernel decides *what* to constrain and *whether to at all*.
//! The policy below is the kernel's; an implementation may only report how
//! much of it it managed to deliver.
//!
//! **The hard invariant: a policy that asked for constraint must never
//! silently become an unconstrained run.** A backend that cannot deliver says
//! so through [`Enforcement`], and the caller — with
//! `sandbox.require_enforcement` — decides whether to refuse. A `warn!` nobody
//! reads is not a decision.
