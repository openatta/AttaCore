/// file, and a tool result is capped long before a file could be large enough
/// to need chunking. Designing a streaming interface with no consumer would
/// oblige every implementation to provide one.
///
/// **Path safety is not here.** Whether a path may be written is a policy —
/// it answers the same question regardless of which machine the file is on,
/// and a provider that decided its own out-of-bounds rules could cancel them.
/// It stays in `permissions::path_safety`, above this contract.
///
/// One thing does cross: [`canonicalize`](Self::canonicalize). A remote's
/// symlink graph is the remote's, so resolving one here would answer about the
/// wrong filesystem. The order is: canonicalize through the provider, check
/// the resolved path against the policy, then write through the provider.
