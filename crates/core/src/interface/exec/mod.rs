//! The execution layer — how a tool touches the machine.
//!
//! Four contracts, designed as one because they are entangled: a sandbox
//! constrains a process, a process needs files and a network, and the network
//! policy has to reach inside the sandbox. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §5 is
//! the blueprint; this module is its vocabulary.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not here
//!
//! An execution layer is the easiest place in an engine for a second kernel to
//! grow, so the boundary is written down rather than assumed. Retries,
//! timeouts, caching and metrics belong to [`tool_middleware`]; whether a
//! provider is healthy belongs to [`health`]; kept time belongs to
//! [`environment`]; path safety is a policy and stays with `permissions`; and
//! the sandbox *policy* — what to constrain and whether to constrain at all —
//! is the kernel's. A provider decides *how* to constrain, never *whether*.
