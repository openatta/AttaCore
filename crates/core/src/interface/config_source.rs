//! `ConfigSource` — where the settings layers come from.
//!
//! `Settings::load` merges three tiers, each with a gitignored overlay beside
//! it, and it read all six with `std::fs::read_to_string`. That made the file
//! system part of the definition of "configuration": a deployment that keeps
//! its settings in a config service, a Kubernetes ConfigMap, or a database had
//! no way in that did not involve writing six files to disk first so the
//! engine could read them back.
//!
//! What moves is only *where the layers come from*. The merge — six layers
//! low-to-high, generic recursive JSON merge, `paths` stripped from every
//! layer, `permission_rules` from an overlay held apart — stays exactly where
//! it was, in [`crate::settings::Settings::load_from`]. A source hands over
//! JSON values in priority order and has no say in what happens to them,
//! which is what keeps "settings come from somewhere else" from turning into
//! "settings mean something else".
//!
//! # A source reports its own failures and yields nothing
//!
//! `Settings::load` never fails: a layer that is absent is skipped, and one
//! that will not parse is skipped with a warning rather than taking startup
//! down with it. That property belongs to the loader and cannot be delegated,
//! so [`ConfigSource::layers`] returns layers rather than a `Result` — a
//! source that cannot reach its backing store logs why and returns what it
//! has. Losing a layer is bad; refusing to start because a remote service is
//! slow is worse.
//!
//! # Synchronous, and a remote source is still a fit
//!
//! Configuration is read once, before anything is built, and every caller of
//! `Settings::load` today is synchronous. A source that has to go over a
//! network fetches in [`ConfigSource::layers`] — it is called once per process
//! and is allowed to be slow — or fetches ahead of time and hands the result
//! over as [`InMemoryLayers`]. [`Chain`] is for the common shape of the second
//! case: the files on disk, with what the control plane says layered on top.
