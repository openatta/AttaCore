//! `PromptAssembler` — the algorithm that turns every contribution into the
//! blocks one request carries.
//!
//! Contributing a block and rewriting one are already open: a registration
//! adds, an `AssemblyHook` gets a last pass over the result. What was not open
//! is the assembly itself — the order stages are placed in, how a
//! contribution's order merges with the kernel's, where the cache boundaries
//! fall, whether two blocks stay two blocks. Those are decisions
//! [`assemble_prompt_with`](crate::prompt::assemble_prompt_with) makes, and a
//! deployment that wants different ones had to make them by bolting a hook on
//! the end and undoing the arrangement it had just been handed.
//!
//! # The inputs are a value
//!
//! Assembly reads seven things. Passing them as a struct is not a style
//! preference: an implementation that wants only two should not have to
//! restate the other five, and a new input should not break every
//! implementation that never asked for one.
