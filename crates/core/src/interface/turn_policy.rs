//! `TurnPolicy` — when a turn has gone on long enough.
//!
//! A turn is a loop: call the model, run what it asked for, call it again. Two
//! judgements decide when that loop ends, and both were constants compiled
//! into the middle of a twelve-hundred-line function — a ceiling on model
//! calls, and a ceiling on structured-output retries. Neither is a fact about
//! how an agent works; both are opinions about how long is too long, and
//! different deployments hold different ones.
//!
//! # What is a judgement here, and what is not
//!
//! Only judgements about *progress* belong behind this contract. Three other
//! things end a turn and none of them is one:
//!
//! * **Cancellation** — the session was stopped. That is an instruction, and
//!   interruption is kernel-only for a reason: a policy that could decline to
//!   stop is a policy that could refuse to be stopped.
//! * **A hook said stop** — `PostToolUse` discontinuing, or a `Stop` hook.
//!   Those are already an extension point's output. Letting a policy overrule
//!   one would invert the trust order: the operator configured the hook, and
//!   the policy might have arrived with a plugin.
//! * **The model asked for tools, so there is more to do.** That is the loop's
//!   definition rather than an opinion about it — the skeleton, which stays
//!   closed (design §5 item 7).
//!
//! # Asked where the judgements already happen
//!
//! Two methods rather than one, because the two ceilings are checked at
//! different points today and consolidating them would reorder the loop. The
//! call ceiling is checked before spending a call; the retry ceiling after one
//! comes back. Moving either would be a behavior change wearing a refactor's
//! clothes.
