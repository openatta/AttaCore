//! `RecoveryPolicy` — what to do when a model call goes wrong.
//!
//! Three failures had three hardcoded answers. A provider reporting overload
//! switched to the configured fallback model, or failed if there was none. A
//! request refused for size triggered one compaction and one retry, or failed.
//! A response cut off at the output limit escalated the limit — to 64K the
//! first time, 8K after that, three attempts, with a fixed nudge appended.
//!
//! Every one of those is a reasonable answer and none of them is the only
//! one. A deployment on a single model has no fallback to switch to and would
//! rather wait. One paying per token would rather fail than escalate to 64K.
//! One with a cheap second provider would rather switch on *any* error, not
//! only overload.
//!
//! # The policy decides; the loop acts
//!
//! Recovery *mechanisms* — compacting, rebuilding a request, sending it —
//! belong to the turn: they touch the session, the compactor and the model in
//! ways that only the loop can sequence correctly. What was missing is the
//! choice between them. So this contract answers "what should happen", in a
//! vocabulary the loop already implements, and nothing else. That is what
//! keeps the skeleton closed (design §5 item 7) while the decision opens.
//!
//! # Attempt counts are the policy's memory
//!
//! Both recovery paths bound themselves with a counter the loop kept. The
//! counters are still the loop's — they belong to one turn, and a policy is
//! shared across turns — but they are *given* to the policy, so a policy that
//! wants to allow four escalations rather than three needs no state of its
//! own.
