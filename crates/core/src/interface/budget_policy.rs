//! `BudgetPolicy` — what a turn is allowed to spend, and how much context it
//! may carry.
//!
//! Three judgements, all of them constants before this: a cumulative token
//! ceiling read straight off settings, an output-volume target with three
//! magic numbers deciding when to stop asking for more, and a compaction
//! threshold the scene returned as a pair of numbers with no ceiling above
//! them. The last one is the gap that matters: `TokenBudget` said when to
//! start compacting and never said how large a context was too large, so
//! there was no configuration that could answer "never send a request bigger
//! than this".
//!
//! # Two ceilings that look alike and are not
//!
//! `Spending` is about the bill, accumulated across the turn and checked
//! against what the provider actually reported. `OutputTarget` is about the
//! opposite problem — the model stopping short of the volume of work that was
//! asked for. One ends a turn that has spent too much, the other prolongs a
//! turn that has produced too little. They stay separate methods because
//! merging them would let "write more" and "you have spent enough" argue with
//! each other inside one verdict.
//!
//! # What counts as spent is the policy's call, not the engine's
//!
//! [`Spend`] carries the provider's four figures apart rather than one sum.
//! There is no reading of them that is right for every deployment: a cache
//! read is billed at a fraction of ordinary input, so counting it whole
//! overstates the bill, and dropping it understates a cache-heavy turn by
//! most of what it read. Both answers are defensible and they are not the
//! engine's to choose, which is the reason this is a policy at all. The
//! engine reports; [`Spend::total_tokens`] and [`Spend::all_tokens`] name the
//! two obvious readings, and a policy that wants a third has the parts.
//!
//! `ContextBudget` is neither: it is about the size of a single request, not
//! the cost of the turn.
