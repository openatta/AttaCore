//! `CredentialSource` — where the engine's API keys come from.
//!
//! Two places, historically, and neither was replaceable: the daemon read
//! `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`/`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` out of the environment for its
//! primary client, and every other provider's key was read straight out of
//! `settings.json`, in plaintext, because that is where the field is.
//!
//! That is fine on a laptop and disqualifying for a host that is not allowed
//! to have a credential on disk at all — a service pulling from a vault, an
//! operator injecting per-request identity, anything with rotation. There was
//! no seam to hand any of them: the key was read at the construction site,
//! from a struct field, by name.
//!
//! # The value never comes back as a `String`
//!
//! Credentials leak through the boring paths — a `{:?}` on a config struct, a
//! telemetry payload built by serializing something that happened to hold one.
//! [`Secret`] exists so that cannot happen by accident: it does not implement
//! `Display`, it does not implement `Serialize`, and its `Debug` prints
//! nothing. Reading the value takes [`Secret::expose`], which is verbose on
//! purpose — a call to it is a place to look during review.
