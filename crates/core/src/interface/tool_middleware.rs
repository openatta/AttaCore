//! `ToolMiddleware` — the ring around tool dispatch.
//!
//! Timeouts, retries, metrics, caching, idempotent de-duplication: none of
//! these belong to a tool's implementation and none of them are permission
//! decisions. They are the things you wrap a call in. With nowhere to put
//! them, they get hardcoded into the loop — which is where the engine's
//! existing timeout and retry logic lives today, and why adding a per-tool
//! deadline currently means editing the turn.
//!
//! # What a wrapper may do, and the one thing it may not
//!
//! It may **narrow the signal**: hand the call a stricter cancellation than
//! the turn's, which is how a timeout is expressed. It may **short-circuit**:
//! answer without calling through at all, which is how a cache hit is
//! expressed. It may **call through more than once**, which is how a retry is
//! expressed.
//!
//! It may not rewrite the call's input. That is a different act with a
//! different risk — rewriting arguments turns an approved call into a
//! different call, after approval — and it belongs to a hook point of its own
//! with its own trust rules. Here it is not a rule to remember, it is a thing
//! the types do not let you say: the call arrives behind a shared reference
//! and dispatch takes no arguments.
//!
//! # Order
//!
//! Wrappers nest in registration order: the first registered is outermost, so
//! it sees the others' retries as one call. That is the ordering a metrics
//! wrapper wants (register it first and it measures everything inside) and
//! the one a cache wants (register it first and a hit costs nothing further
//! in).
