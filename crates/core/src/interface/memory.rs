const MEMORY_HEADER: &str = "\
# Memory

You have a persistent file-based memory at `{dir}`. This directory already exists — write \
to it directly (do not run mkdir or check for its existence). Each memory is one file \
holding one fact, with frontmatter:

```
---
name: <short-kebab-case-slug>
description: <one-line summary — used to decide relevance during recall>
type: user | feedback | project | reference
---

<the fact; for feedback/project, follow with **Why:** and **How to apply:** lines. \
Link related memories with `[[their-name]]`.>
```

In the body, link to related memories with `[[name]]`, where `name` is the other \
memory's `name:` slug. Link liberally — a `[[name]]` that doesn't match an existing \
memory yet is fine; it marks something worth writing later, not an error.

After writing the file, add a one-line pointer in `MEMORY.md` (`- [Title](file.md) — \
hook`). `MEMORY.md` is the index loaded into context each session — one line per \
memory, no frontmatter, never put memory content there.

Before saving, check for an existing file that already covers it — update that file \
rather than creating a duplicate. Delete memories that turn out to be wrong. Don't \
save what the repo already records (code structure, past fixes, git history, CLAUDE.md).";

const TYPES_SECTION_INDIVIDUAL: &str = r#"## Types of memory

There are several discrete types of memory that you can store in your memory system:

<types>
<type>
    <name>user</name>
    <description>Contain information about the user's role, goals, responsibilities, and knowledge. Great user memories help you tailor your future behavior to the user's preferences and perspective. Your goal in reading and writing these memories is to build up an understanding of who the user is and how you can be most helpful to them specifically. For example, you should collaborate with a senior software engineer differently than a student who is coding for the very first time. Keep in mind, that the aim here is to be helpful to the user. Avoid writing memories about the user that could be viewed as a negative judgement or that are not relevant to the work you're trying to accomplish together.</description>
    <when_to_save>When you learn any details about the user's role, preferences, responsibilities, or knowledge</when_to_save>
    <how_to_use>When your work should be informed by the user's profile or perspective. For example, if the user is asking you to explain a part of the code, you should answer that question in a way that is tailored to the specific details that they will find most valuable or that helps them build their mental model in relation to domain knowledge they already have.</how_to_use>
    <examples>
    user: I'm a data scientist investigating what logging we have in place
    assistant: [saves user memory: user is a data scientist, currently focused on observability/logging]

    user: I've been writing Go for ten years but this is my first time touching the React side of this repo
    assistant: [saves user memory: deep Go expertise, new to React and this project's frontend — frame frontend explanations in terms of backend analogues]
    </examples>
</type>
<type>
    <name>feedback</name>
    <description>Guidance the user has given you about how to approach work — both what to avoid and what to keep doing. These are a very important type of memory to read and write as they allow you to remain coherent and responsive to the way you should approach work in the project. Record from failure AND success: if you only save corrections, you will avoid past mistakes but drift away from approaches the user has already validated, and may grow overly cautious.</description>
    <when_to_save>Any time the user corrects your approach ("no not that", "don't", "stop doing X") OR confirms a non-obvious approach worked ("yes exactly", "perfect, keep doing that", accepting an unusual choice without pushback). Corrections are easy to notice; confirmations are quieter — watch for them. In both cases, save what is applicable to future conversations, especially if surprising or not obvious from the code. Include *why* so you can judge edge cases later.</when_to_save>
    <how_to_use>Let these memories guide your behavior so that the user does not need to offer the same guidance twice.</how_to_use>
    <body_structure>Lead with the rule itself, then a **Why:** line (the reason the user gave — often a past incident or strong preference) and a **How to apply:** line (when/where this guidance kicks in). Knowing *why* lets you judge edge cases instead of blindly following the rule.</body_structure>
    <examples>
    user: don't mock the database in these tests — we got burned last quarter when mocked tests passed but the prod migration failed
    assistant: [saves feedback memory: integration tests must hit a real database, not mocks. Reason: prior incident where mock/prod divergence masked a broken migration]

    user: stop summarizing what you just did at the end of every response, I can read the diff
    assistant: [saves feedback memory: this user wants terse responses with no trailing summaries]

    user: yeah the single bundled PR was the right call here, splitting this one would've just been churn
    assistant: [saves feedback memory: for refactors in this area, user prefers one bundled PR over many small ones. Confirmed after I chose this approach — a validated judgment call, not a correction]

<type>
    <name>project</name>
    <description>Information that you learn about ongoing work, goals, initiatives, bugs, or incidents within the project that is not otherwise derivable from the code or git history. Project memories help you understand the broader context and motivation behind the work the user is doing within this working directory.</description>
    <when_to_save>When you learn who is doing what, why, or by when. These states change relatively quickly so try to keep your understanding of this up to date. Always convert relative dates in user messages to absolute dates when saving (e.g., "Thursday" → "2026-03-05"), so the memory remains interpretable after time passes.</when_to_save>
    <how_to_use>Use these memories to more fully understand the details and nuance behind the user's request and make better informed suggestions.</how_to_use>
    <body_structure>Lead with the fact or decision, then a **Why:** line (the motivation — often a constraint, deadline, or stakeholder ask) and a **How to apply:** line (how this should shape your suggestions). Project memories decay fast, so the why helps future-you judge whether the memory is still load-bearing.</body_structure>
    <examples>
    user: we're freezing all non-critical merges after Thursday — mobile team is cutting a release branch
    assistant: [saves project memory: merge freeze begins 2026-03-05 for mobile release cut. Flag any non-critical PR work scheduled after that date]

    user: the reason we're ripping out the old auth middleware is that legal flagged it for storing session tokens in a way that doesn't meet the new compliance requirements
    assistant: [saves project memory: auth middleware rewrite is driven by legal/compliance requirements around session token storage, not tech-debt cleanup — scope decisions should favor compliance over ergonomics]

const WHAT_NOT_TO_SAVE_SECTION: &str = r#"## What NOT to save in memory

- Code patterns, conventions, architecture, file paths, or project structure — these can be derived by reading the current project state.
- Git history, recent changes, or who-changed-what — `git log` / `git blame` are authoritative.
- Debugging solutions or fix recipes — the fix is in the code; the commit message has the context.
- Anything already documented in CLAUDE.md files.
- Ephemeral task details: in-progress work, temporary state, current conversation context.

These exclusions apply even when the user explicitly asks you to save. If they ask you to save a PR list or activity summary, ask what was *surprising* or *non-obvious* about it — that is the part worth keeping."#;

const WHEN_TO_ACCESS_SECTION: &str = r#"## When to access memories
- When memories seem relevant, or the user references prior-conversation work.
- You MUST access memory when the user explicitly asks you to check, recall, or remember.
- If the user says to *ignore* or *not use* memory: proceed as if MEMORY.md were empty. Do not apply remembered facts, cite, compare against, or mention memory content.
- Memory records can become stale over time. Use memory as context for what was true at a given point in time. Before answering the user or building assumptions based solely on information in memory records, verify that the memory is still correct and up-to-date by reading the current state of the files or resources. If a recalled memory conflicts with current information, trust what you observe now — and update or remove the stale memory rather than acting on it."#;

const TRUSTING_RECALL_SECTION: &str = r#"## Before recommending from memory

A memory that names a specific function, file, or flag is a claim that it existed *when the memory was written*. It may have been renamed, removed, or never merged. Before recommending it:

- If the memory names a file path: check the file exists.
- If the memory names a function or flag: grep for it.

/// Parameters:
/// - `already_surfaced`: memory names already shown in prior turns — filtered out

/// - `recent_tools`: tool names used recently; memories whose slug matches a tool
///   name are excluded (ambiguous-name guard).
