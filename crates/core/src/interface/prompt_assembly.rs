//! The assembly hook point: a last pass over the whole prompt, with authority
//! that depends on where the pass came from.
//!
//! Registration ([`crate::interface::prompt_registry`]) covers contributing.
//! It does not cover *editing* — reading what everything else produced and
//! changing it. Some of what an extension legitimately wants is only
//! expressible that way: strip a section that does not apply to this
//! deployment, rewrite a paragraph the model keeps misreading, move a block
//! the cache would rather see earlier.
//!
//! # Editing a prompt is not the same act as adding to one
//!
//! Adding is bounded: whatever a contribution says, everything else still
//! says what it said. Removal and rewriting are not — a block that silently
//! deletes `rules` turns off a safety mechanism its author never agreed to
//! turn off, and the result looks exactly like a system that has no rules
//! configured.
//!
//! So authority follows provenance. Something the operator wrote themselves —
//! a script in their project, their own configuration — may do anything they
//! could have done by editing the prompt by hand, because it *is* them. A
//! plugin they downloaded may add, and may do more only if it declared the
//! capability, which is what an install-time disclosure has to show them.
//!
//! # A refusal is visible, not silent
//!
//! A denied edit returns [`Denied`] and is counted on the assembly. A hook
//! that ignores the error still cannot make the change, and the count is what
//! lets a host tell "this plugin does nothing" apart from "this plugin is
//! being stopped from doing something".
