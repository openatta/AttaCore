//! `ModelInterceptor` — the request on its way out, and the message on its
//! way back.
//!
//! Two moments matter for anyone who wants to shape what the engine says to a
//! provider and what it does with the answer: just before a request is sent,
//! when the messages, tools and parameters are assembled and nothing has left
//! the process yet; and just after a complete message has been assembled from
//! a stream, when it is whole enough to reason about.
//!
//! # There is deliberately no per-chunk hook
//!
//! The obvious third moment — every streamed delta — is the one this does not
//! offer. A turn produces thousands of chunks, so a hook there is called
//! thousands of times, and the cost is invisible to whoever writes it: their
//! function looks cheap, the streaming looks broken. Worse, a hook that can
//! rewrite chunks can produce a message that never existed as a coherent
//! whole, which nothing downstream is built to handle.
//!
//! So the contract offers complete things: the complete request, the complete
//! message. Both are called once per model call, which
//! [`does_not_run_per_chunk`](self) has a test for. If a deployment genuinely
//! needs to transform a stream as it arrives, the answer is a declarative rule
//! the engine executes natively — not a callback in the chunk loop.
