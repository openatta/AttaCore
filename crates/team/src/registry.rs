//! Shared registry of teams created via `TeamCreate`.
//!
//! `TeamCreateTool`, `TeamListTool`, and `TeamDeleteTool` are three separate
//! `Tool` instances, each wrapping its own `DefaultCoordinator` — team state
//! doesn't live inside any single one of them, it has to live somewhere all
//! three can reach. This is that somewhere: an `Arc`-shared, `RwLock`-guarded
//! map, constructed once per session (`runtime::agent::Builder::build()`) and
//! handed to all three tools' coordinators via `DefaultCoordinator::with_registry`.
