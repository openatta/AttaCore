//! The search tools against a project big enough to hit their limits.
//!
//! Every existing test for `Grep`, `Glob` and `Read` runs against a handful
//! of files written inline, which is the wrong size to catch anything: the
//! behavior that matters at scale is what these tools do when there is *too
//! much* — the 250-match head limit, a glob spanning hundreds of paths, a
//! file longer than one screenful. None of that is reachable with four
//! files, so none of it was covered.
//!
//! The tree is generated rather than committed. A few hundred files of
//! plausible-looking source would be a few hundred files nobody reads, and
//! the properties here care about shape and volume, not content.
