//! What a write tool refuses, asked through the tool.
//!
//! The engine carried two write-path checks with the same name. The thorough
//! one — credential filenames, system directories, Unicode normalization —
//! documented itself as the guard for `FileWrite` / `FileEdit` and was never
//! called by it; the tools used a ten-line one that only asked whether the
//! path stayed inside the project.
//!
//! It survived that long because every one of its rules had a unit test, and
//! every one of those called the function directly. Nothing asked the tool.
//! So these do.
