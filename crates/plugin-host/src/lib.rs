//! Binds installed plugins to the engine's [`PluginHost`] seam.
//!
//! This crate is the only place that knows both halves: `plugin`'s on-disk
//! manifests on one side, `runtime`'s engine types on the other. Keeping the
//! translation here is what lets `runtime` stay free of any plugin dependency
//! and lets the whole subsystem be an optional dependency of the host — see
//! `runtime::plugin_host`.
