//! Receiving a server's notifications.

//! MCP is bidirectional: a server can tell the client its tool list changed
//! rather than waiting to be asked again. `McpNotification` and
//! `McpManager::dispatch_notification` were written for that and then never
//! connected to a transport — nothing in the process ever constructed one,
//! so a server announcing new tools was talking to a wall.
//!
//! This is the missing half. The client handler that rmcp drives is no
//! longer the unit type, and forwards the notifications we act on.
