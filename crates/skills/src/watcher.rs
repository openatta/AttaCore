//! # SkillWatcher — watches skill directories for file changes.
//!
//! Uses the `notify` crate to monitor SKILL.md / *.md files in skill directories.
//! When a skill file is modified, added, or removed, the path is collected.
//! Callers poll via [`SkillWatcher::check_and_reload`] to pick up changes.
