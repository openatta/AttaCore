//! Keeps `hooks::UNWIRED_EVENTS` honest.
//!
//! `HookEvent` has variants that parse, accept configuration, and never fire.
//! They are kept deliberately (see the const's doc comment for why deleting
//! one is worse than it looks), and `build_hook_runner` warns when someone
//! configures a hook for one. That warning is only worth anything if the list
//! it reads from is accurate — and a hand-maintained list of "things that are
//! not wired yet" is exactly the kind of comment that rots the moment someone
//! wires one up and forgets it exists.
//!
//! So the list is not trusted here: this recomputes it from the production
//! sources and fails if the two disagree **in either direction**. Wiring an
//! event without removing it from the const fails. Adding a variant that
//! nothing fires without listing it fails too.
//!
//! Same technique and the same caveat as `wiring_coverage.rs`: this is a
//! source-text scan, not call-graph analysis. It answers "does production
//! composition code name this event", which is the question that matters for
//! this particular bug class, and nothing more.
