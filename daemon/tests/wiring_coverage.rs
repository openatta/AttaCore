//! Guards against the "library capability exists, composition root never
//! calls it" bug pattern found repeatedly across this codebase during a
//! 2026-08-12 audit — `tools::register_builtin_tools` never called by
//! `daemon`, `hooks::HookRunner::enable_file_watching` never called by
//! `runtime::agent::Builder::build()`, `mcp::McpManager::set_elicitation_callback`
//! likewise. Each of those compiled cleanly and had passing unit tests in
//! isolation; the only thing that would have caught them earlier is asking
//! "does the production entry point actually call this?"
//!
//! This is a source-text reachability check, not real call-graph analysis —
//! it greps for whether a function name string appears anywhere in the two
//! places production wiring actually happens (`daemon/src/**` and
//! `crates/runtime/src/agent.rs`, see that file's `Builder::build()`), for a
//! curated list of "wiring-shaped" functions from library crates. It cannot
//! prove a call is *correct*, only that the identifier is referenced from a
//! composition root instead of sitting completely unreferenced outside its
//! own crate.
//!
//! AttaCore is also a library other embedders build their own composition
//! root on top of,
//! so a function genuinely meant for external embedders — not this repo's
//! own `daemon` — is a legitimate exception, not a bug. Those go in
//! `INTENTIONALLY_UNWIRED` below, each with a one-line reason, so adding one
//! is a conscious decision instead of the check silently going blind.
//!
//! # A composition root that is not the daemon's
//!
//! The check above asks whether the *main* session gets a capability. It
//! cannot see the other place sessions are built: `AgentTool` and its
//! neighbours spawn sub-agents, team members and background tasks, each with a
//! `Builder` of their own. A capability wired into the main session and not
//! into those is invisible to the check and to everything else — which is how
//! the operator's scripts came to stop at the first delegation, and how
//! transcripts and telemetry each came to be missing from a delegate before
//! that. The second test here is about that root.
