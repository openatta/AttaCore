//! The protocol doc and the code describe the same set of methods, and the
//! same set of stream events.
//!
//! `docs/daemon_rpc_protocol.md` is what someone writes a client against.
//! When it drifts, both directions hurt and neither is visible from the
//! code: a documented method that does not exist fails at runtime with
//! METHOD_NOT_FOUND, and an implemented method nobody documented is a
//! capability clients never learn about.
//!
//! Both had happened. At the time this test was written the doc described
//! fifteen methods with no dispatch arm — `daemon.ping` among them, the one
//! it recommends for keepalive — and eleven methods were implemented with
//! no entry in the doc.
//!
//! The same drift is possible one level down, in the events: §7's table is a
//! whitelist of `session.event` kinds, and the whitelist in the code is the
//! `match` in `run_turn`'s forwarding loop. Nothing compared them, so an
//! event could be documented and never sent — a client waiting forever for a
//! frame that does not exist — or sent and never documented. The `compact`
//! kind was added with nothing checking either direction.
//!
//! Source-text scanning: match arms out of `dispatch`, `#### \`name\``
//! headings out of §6, `AgentEvent` arms out of the forwarding loop, table
//! rows out of §7. It cannot check that a documented *shape* is right,
//! only that both sides agree on what exists. That is the failure that kept
//! happening.
