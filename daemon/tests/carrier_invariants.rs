//! The four rules that hold for every extension carrier, as tests.
//!
//! WebAssembly is one carrier and a script engine is the next. The failure
//! mode when a second carrier arrives is not that it is written badly — it is
//! that it is written *separately*: its own allow-list, its own idea of what a
//! declaration means, its own path from an extension to the host. Each of
//! those drifts from the first carrier's, and the drift is discovered by an
//! incident rather than by a test.
//!
//! So the rules are checked here rather than remembered:
//!
//! 1. One capability table and one authorization function, shared.
//! 2. Carriers do not call each other.
//! 3. A carrier is a compile-time feature.
//! 4. Disclosure covers every carrier, not just the sandboxed one.
//!
//! Same technique and the same caveat as `hook_event_wiring.rs`: a source-text
//! scan, not call-graph analysis. It answers "does this crate's source reach
//! for that", which is the question that matters for this bug class.
