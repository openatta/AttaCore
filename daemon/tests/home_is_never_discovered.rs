//! No crate may find its own state directory.
//!
//! Where an instance keeps its state is decided once, by the process entry
//! point, and passed down. A module that reads `$HOME` instead has quietly
//! opted out: it writes to the invoking user's home no matter what the
//! instance was configured with, which breaks redirected deployments and is
//! why test runs used to leave files in a real `~/.atta`.
//!
//! Injecting the roots fixed the readers that existed. This test is what
//! keeps the next one from being added — the failure mode is not a bug
//! anyone notices, it is a file appearing somewhere nobody looks.
//!
//! Source-text scanning, not real analysis: it greps for the env lookups
//! that resolve a home directory. That is enough, because the point is to
//! make adding one a deliberate act — you have to come here and write down
//! why.
