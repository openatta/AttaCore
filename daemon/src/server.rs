//! Daemon server — JSON-RPC over Unix socket / TCP.
//!
//! Accepts newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 requests, dispatches them
//! to the agent engine, and streams events back as `StreamFrame` lines.
//!
//! The framing is the only part that belongs to a transport. `dispatch` takes
//! a request and a [`Sink`], so `crate::ws` carries the same protocol over
//! WebSocket without reimplementing any of it — and, more to the point,
//! without being able to drift from the auth handshake this module defines.
//!
//! **Trust boundary**: every RPC method here — including `config.setProvider`
//! (writes `providers.<id>.api_key`/`base_url` into settings.json) — trusts
//! whoever can reach this socket. There is no per-method authorization on
//! top of that: Unix socket
//! file permissions are the entire access-control story locally. For TCP,
//! each connection must open with a `daemon.auth` handshake carrying the
//! shared token (`--token`/`ATTACORE_DAEMON_TOKEN`, see
//! [`DaemonServer::authenticate_tcp`]) before any other method is dispatched
//! — once a connection passes the handshake it is trusted for its lifetime,
//! same as a Unix socket connection. In particular, `config.setProvider` lets
//! any authenticated caller point future LLM traffic at an
//! attacker-controlled `base_url`/`api_key` — treat socket/token exposure
//! with the same care as exposing the LLM credentials themselves.
//!
//! What that boundary does *not* cover any more is tool execution.
//! `session.run_turn` used to run every session under an unconditional
//! allow-all `Permission` ("IDE plugins manage their own sandbox"); it now
//! defaults to `ask` and raises `session.event{kind:"prompt"}` frames that
//! `session.respondToPrompt` answers. See `daemon/src/main.rs`'s
//! `AllowAllPermission` doc comment for why the boundary moved, and
//! `docs/daemon_rpc_protocol.md` for the opt-out.
