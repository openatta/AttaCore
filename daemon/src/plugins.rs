//! The plugin subsystem, behind one type the rest of the daemon talks to.
//!
//! Two questions, and they are not the same question. *Can this build read a
//! package?* — manifest, fetch, checksum, unpack, cache, disclose, enable —
//! is the `plugin-packages` feature, and it needs no runtime. *Can this build
//! run a package's WebAssembly components?* is the `plugins` feature, which
//! pulls in wasmtime and is exclusive with the script carrier.
//!
//! They used to be one feature, and the cost was that the default build could
//! not install a package at all: a package whose whole content was an MCP
//! server or a script — nothing to run in-process — was refused for want of a
//! WebAssembly engine it never needed.
//!
//! So there are three implementations of the same API here, selected by
//! feature: packages with a carrier, packages without one, and neither. The
//! rest of the daemon needs no conditional compilation of its own, and a
//! locked-down build stays a build-flag decision rather than a code path
//! anyone has to remember to take.
//!
//! Build the locked-down artifact with
//! `cargo build -p daemon --no-default-features`. Not `--workspace`: cargo
//! unifies features across the graph, so any other member enabling a feature
//! turns it back on.
