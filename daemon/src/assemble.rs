//! Building a running engine out of a configuration.
//!
//! The order these pieces go together in, and what they default to, is the
//! engine's knowledge rather than its embedder's. Before this module every
//! host had to know it: read the settings, resolve the provider routing,
//! build the credentials and the client, place the history roots, migrate an
//! old layout, hand eleven positional arguments to [`SessionPool::new`] in
//! the right order, then remember the three startup steps a session silently
//! misses without — plugin components, MCP connection, the janitor.
//!
//! That knowledge was copied. `main.rs` had it, the test harness had it
//! ("`SessionPool::new` the way `main.rs` does", it said), and every
//! daemon-level test file had a shortened version of its own. A copy is not
//! merely duplication here: when the assembly changes, nothing tells the
//! copies. There is no compile error for a step nobody performs.
//!
//! So this is the one place that knows. `main.rs` is a command line and a set
//! of listeners on top of it, and a host embedding the daemon hands over a
//! [`DaemonConfig`] and gets back an engine.
//!
//! What stays out: anything with a process to itself. Discovery locks,
//! listeners, signal handling and startup telemetry belong to whatever *runs*
//! a daemon, and a host embedding one has its own answers for all four.

/// Allow-everything permission — **the opt-out**, no longer the default.
///
/// The original design comment here read "always-allow permission for daemon
/// sessions (IDE plugins manage their own sandbox)". That was a real
/// decision, not an oversight: the daemon's callers were assumed to be
/// editor plugins that had already sandboxed the workspace themselves, so a
/// second permission layer inside the engine would only have been friction,
/// and nothing on the wire could answer a prompt anyway.
///
/// **That boundary moved on purpose.** Two things changed underneath it.
/// First, the daemon grew a real answer channel — `session.respondToPrompt`
/// plus the `kind:"prompt"` stream frame — so "stop and ask" is now
/// expressible over JSON-RPC instead of being a dead end. Second, the
/// caller population stopped being "editor plugins we shipped": anything
/// that can open the socket gets a fully-tooled agent with Bash and file
/// writes, and "the host sandboxes it" became an assumption the daemon was
/// making on the host's behalf rather than one the host had stated.
///
/// So the default is now `PermissionMode::Default` (ask), and a host that
/// genuinely does sandbox the daemon states so explicitly — either
/// `"permission_mode": "bypassPermissions"` in any settings.json tier
/// (daemon-wide) or `options.permission_mode: "bypassPermissions"` on
/// `session.run_turn` (one session). Both resolve to *this* instance; see
/// `daemon::session_pool::resolve_session_permission` and
/// `docs/daemon_rpc_protocol.md`'s "权限默认值" section.
///
/// Kept as a distinct type rather than folded into `RuleSetPermission`'s
/// bypass mode because the two aren't quite the same: `PermissionGate` keeps
/// a small bypass-immune deny list (`is_path_bypass_immune`) that still
/// fires under `bypassPermissions`, whereas this really does permit
/// everything — which is what "I have my own sandbox" asks for.
///
/// The pool holds one instance and hands it out only to sessions whose
/// effective `permission_mode` is `bypassPermissions`; everything else gets a
/// real `RuleSetPermission` built from the settings.
